# How to deploy on personal computer
First of all, open the Apache Friends website and download XAMPP for Windows, and install it.<br>
Start the XAMPP Program Control Panel. Click on the “Start”  button next to the “Apache” to start your Apache Web Server. Also, start “MySQL” if your PHP programs depend on a MySQL database to run.<br>
Download the files or clone the repository. <br>
Set the location of downloaded files to htdocs. Place your PHP files in the “htdocs” folder located under the “XAMPP” folder on your drive (i.e. C/D/E etc). The initial path is “your_drive_letter:\xampp\htdocs” for your Web server. Make sure that your PHP files are saved as a “.php” file extension.<br>
Open up any web browser and enter “localhost/filename”. This will open the list of all the files and folders stored under the “htdocs” folder on your computer. Click on the link to a PHP file and open it to run a program.<br>
Enter “localhost/php_project/” in your browser and press enter, your program will be run.<br>
